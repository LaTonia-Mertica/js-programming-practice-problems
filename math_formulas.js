/*

- square = num*num
- area of triangle = (base*height)/2
- area of rectangle = length*width
- perimeter of triangle = side+base+side
- perimeter of triangle = side+side+side
- perimeter of rectangle = 2*(length+width)

circumference aka
perimeter of circle
- 3.14 (pi) multiplied by diameter
- c=2PIr in units
- 3.14 aka 22/7

area of circle
- pi*radius to power of 2
- 3.14*(radius**2)
- can use Math.PI for pi aka 3.14

squareroot
- num multiplied by itself
- Math.sqrt();

exponential
- Math.pow(num, exponent)

formula for remainder
- when given two numbers ie. number and
divisor then find the remainder when 
number is divided by the divisor

OR subtract divisor from number and set value
of divisor to value of number until number is
smaller than divisor ... once value of number
is smaller aka lesser than the divisor then
the result/outcome should be the remainder

OR loop to find largest multiple of divisor
that is smaller than or equal to number 
THEN minus the multiple from number to find 
divisor (aka the number to divide by)
