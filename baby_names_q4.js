QUESTION: What are all of the names that were top 40 baby names in both 1880 and 2020?

PSEUDOCODE:
- setup file systen for each file
- variable assigned to array to track/store names that meet criteria
- loop through each name in one file (outer loop)
- loop through names in other file (inner loop)
- check to see if a name exists in both files
---- by comparing each name of each file
---- boolean for direct comparison between the names
- track/store each name that appears in both files
- push to storage
- console log
