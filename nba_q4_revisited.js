QUESTION: 
[üòù] Print out a ranking of who has won the MVP more than once, by times won ie. output:
    - 6 times: Michael Jordan
    - 3 times: Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James
    - 2 times: <etc>

PSEUDOCODE
[x] declare a dict empty with key player name and value times mvp
[x] declare variable assigned to team player name
[x] loop thru nba strings array by row
[x] skip/continue when come to string with no mvp
[x] if player is not in dict add player with value of 1
[x] otherwise add one to player's value
[x] increment each time player is mvp
[x] omit players with only one mvp
[x] order players from most to least mvp wins
[x] console log

task: get the people who mvp'd 3 times and print them together

- store an array of 3 times winners
- loop through whole array of mvps
--- if this mvp's count is 3, store them
print out the array

issue: i have to repeat this list for every value?!

solution: loop through the dict once?

- create a dictionary mapping from mvp count to list of players:
{
  3: ['Shaq', 'LeBron', ...],
  6: ['Michael Jordan']
}
